### About Myself:
From 2016 to 2021, I studied at the Belarusian State University at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. At the university, I was the head of the student organization for two years. 

From September 2021 to November 2021, I worked as a software engineer at a Belarusian metallurgical plant. 

From November 2021 to November 2022, I did military service in Belarus. 
Since December 2022, I have been living in Tbilisi and studying front-end development technologies on my own. I want to become a front-end developer to achieve my goals and plans.
